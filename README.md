# GitTalks

Ever felt difficulty in coping up with git project updates like who and when commited or pushed or pulled or forked or followed or commented? 

Well, Fingers crossed with this Messenger Bot which keeps track of every action performed in an organization by sending you an
automated message to your messenger. 

You can even ask this bot any query yourself like list of commits, issues, followers etc. to keep yourself updated without 
opening github. 

Cool isn't it!

# Steps to follow :

Will update soon! 

Cheers!
